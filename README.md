# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Project Overview
Analysis project for a company called Pewlett Hackard. The analysis is to help the company determine the number of retiring employees as per their job titles and also identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

The project is analyzed using SQL relational databases.

The results show that:
* There are a total of 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement. 
* A large majority of these employees are senior titled employees (64%).

* There are 1550 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. 
* This results in less than 1% of soon to retire staff who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 

# Summary 
* Based on the results there are a large number of employees 90,398 that will need to be hired, trained to replace this soon to retire workforce. Due to the large amount of replacements needed as the "silver tsunami" begins, the HR team will need to build a long term strategy in place in order to fill the large amount of roles. 
* For the mentorship program, only 1550 employees are eligible which is less than 1% of the 90,398 employees that need to be replaced. This does not include whether these employees will be willing to participate in the program, so numbers could further decrease. Based on this, I would recommend that the company reviews other plans to expand the mentorship program to cut down the amount of rehiring that is needed.
